          <h1>Customer Support Real-Time Chat</h1>
          <img src="project1.png">
          <p>This was a web development project I worked on last summer. I learned about the different technologies used to create a web application
          and more specifically, learned how to use the react framework for the front-end and django (python) for the backend. I also worked with websockets for the real-time aspect of it.
          It's still a work in progress, but I'm currently working on implementing a ChatGPT powered Q&A chatbot using OpenAI's API</p>

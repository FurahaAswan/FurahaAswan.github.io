          <h1>Customer Support Real-Time Chat</h1>
          <p>This was a web development project I worked on last summer. I learned about the different technologies used to create a web application
            and more specifically, learned how to use the react framework for the front-end and django (python) for the backend. I also worked with websockets for the real-time aspect of it.
            It's still a work in progress, but I'm currently working on implementing a ChatGPT powered Q&A chatbot using OpenAI's API.</p>

          <h1>Buddy Buffer Memory Manager</h1>
          <p>This was a project that I worked on in CISC 310 - Operating Systems. This is a memory management system that handles the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. It's dynamic and automatic. The memory blocks adjust to the file size. I learned about memory management and got a better understanding of binary trees and linked lists.</p>
